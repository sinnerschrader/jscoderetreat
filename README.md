# JavaScript Coderetreat 2019 - No. 1

> Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design, away from the pressures of 'getting things done'. More about coderetreats! // from the [global day of coderetreat website](https://www.coderetreat.org/) read more [about Coderetreat](https://www.coderetreat.org/pages/about/)

The Javascript Version of the coderetreat was created to improve communities abilities in one specific langugae and its variants (Typescript, coffeescript, es5 etc) which has turned to a lingua franca of the web over the last years. With the advent of modern Javascript versions (es6, Typescripts) there is even more need to upgrade our knowhow, incorporate safe coding practices and improve our skills in general. 

The Main focus is about **pair programming**, where all code is developed with a partner and **T**est **D**riven **D**evelopment (TDD), where you try to test your code as you write it.

Coderetrets focus on a simple, recurring programming task: *Implement "Game of Life"*, 
Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. In multiple rounds of limited time the same problem is tackled using TDD and one constraint. This technique is used to focus on specific programmning techniques rather than finding a specific implementation for Game of life (although exploration is still encouraged). The goal of each round is not a finished implementation, but a clear insight into the applied
